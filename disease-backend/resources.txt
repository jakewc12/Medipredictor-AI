Difference between type 1 and type 2:
    {
        'https://www.niddk.nih.gov/about-niddk/research-areas/diabetes' :
        {
            'Type 1 diabetes affects approximately 6 percent of adults and the majority of children and youth with diagnosed diabetes.',
            'Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of the disease, accounting for about 90 to 94 percent of diagnosed diabetes cases in U.S. adults. Type 2 diabetes is also increasingly being diagnosed in children and adolescents, and disproportionately affects individuals from racial and ethnic minority populations.'

All isn't lost!:

            'bariatric surgery typically results in greater weight loss that affects a person’s metabolic hormones, which improves the body’s response to insulin and ability to maintain healthy blood glucose levels',
            'More participants with surgery achieved diabetes remission compared to participants in the medication/lifestyle group, and the percent of participants using medications to treat diabetes in the surgery group decreased from 98% to 61%, yet remained largely unchanged in the medication/lifestyle group.'

            'The economic analysis of the DPP/DPPOS found that metformin treatment led to a small savings in health care costs over 10 years, compared with placebo. 
            (At present, metformin, an oral drug used to treat type 2 diabetes, is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for diabetes prevention.) 
            The lifestyle intervention as applied in the study was cost-effective, or justified by the benefits of diabetes prevention and improved health over 10 years, compared with placebo.'

How to prevent completely:
    {
        'https://www.niddk.nih.gov/about-niddk/research-areas/diabetes/diabetes-prevention-program-dpp',
        {
            'To date, the DPPOS has shown that participants who took part in the DPP Lifestyle Change Program or are taking metformin continue to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes for at least 15 years.',
            'Metformin was effective for all participating racial and ethnic groups and both men and women. Metformin was most effective in women with a history of gestational diabetes, in people between the ages of 25 and 44, and in people with obesity who had a body mass index of 35 or higher.'
